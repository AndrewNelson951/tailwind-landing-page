# Tailwind Landing Page Starter

This repo is a small landing page starter I use when spinning up new SaaS ideas.

It is meant to get something public fast, so I can focus on copy, structure, and basic presentation before touching product code.

## What this is for

Early on, I usually want to test positioning and messaging, not solve technical problems.

A simple landing page is often enough to see:
• whether the idea makes sense  
• where the pitch breaks down  
• what questions people ask

This starter helps me reach that point quickly.

---

## What is included

• A basic responsive layout using Tailwind  
• Sensible defaults for spacing and typography  
• Minimal setup  
• Easy edits and redeploys

---

## What is not included

There is no app logic, no state management, and no interactive behavior. Those things belong in a product repo, not at this stage.

---

## Status

This is a reusable starter that I keep around as an example for early validation work.

---

## Context

I use this as part of a market-first workflow. The goal is to test ideas cheaply before committing time to deeper builds.

Built to test an idea, not to ship a finished product.

## The Product Experience

The page features a focused Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) structure:

- **Hero Section**: Immediate value capture with clear Call-to-Action.
- **Value Props**: Scannable, numbered benefits to reduce cognitive load.
- **Social Proof**: Trust-building testimonials to overcome early adopter hesitation.
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Fully responsive design ensures we capture the ~60% of traffic originating from mobile devices.
